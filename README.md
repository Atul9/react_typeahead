React Typeahead
* I have implemented typeahead functionality without using typeahead.
* In the folder run python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
* Open browser http://localhost:8000/
* Enter only 3 letters of any country name.
* Matching coutry names will be displayed.
* On selecting any country name the input box will have the selected country name.
